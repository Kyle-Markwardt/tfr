# Total Fertility Rates Data Exploration
This repo exists to investigate certain data about total fertility rates.

I will examine the fertility rate by male or husband occupation. 

I will examine the claim that a high ratio of apartments to single family homes negatively impacts fertility rates, and is not only a correlate.

I may also examine the potential impact on family formation of the negative mental health impacts due to smartphone use by Gen Z teens between 2010-2015.
